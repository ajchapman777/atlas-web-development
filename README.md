Webpage HTML Structure
This project focuses on implementing the HTML structure for a webpage based on a designer file provided in Figma. The HTML structure should follow semantic standards to ensure accessibility and readability.

Designer File
The designer file for this project is available on Figma. You can access the file here.

HTML Structure
The HTML structure will include various elements such as headers, sections, navigation, footer, and more. Each element will be carefully structured to reflect the design provided in the designer file.

Header
The header section typically contains the website logo, navigation menu, and other essential elements. Here's how the header might be structured:


<header>
    <div class="logo">
        <!-- Logo image or text -->
    </div>
    <nav>
        <!-- Navigation menu -->
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
Main Content
The main content section includes various sections and articles depending on the webpage's purpose. It may contain features, services, testimonials, and more. Here's a simplified example:

html

<main>
    <section class="features">
        <!-- Features section content -->
    </section>
    <section class="services">
        <!-- Services section content -->
    </section>
    <section class="testimonials">
        <!-- Testimonials section content -->
    </section>
</main>
Footer
The footer section typically contains additional navigation links, copyright information, and other relevant details. Here's a basic structure:

html

<footer>
    <nav>
        <!-- Additional navigation links -->
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Terms of Service</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">FAQ</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
